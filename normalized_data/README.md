I took ethan's csv file from game stop and my csv file from amazon and organized product_names and prices.

I seperated each product by brand to easily see the data. After that i organized product_names and prices for each brand then concatenated every csv file to one.

The brand files are called 'EVGA0.csv', 'MSI1.csv', 'ROG2.csv', 'ASUS3.csv', 'Playstation4.csv', 'Xbox5.csv'
The concatenated file is called 'normailze_version3.csv'
